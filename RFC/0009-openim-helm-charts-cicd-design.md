## Summary
[summary]: #summary

This RFC proposes a CI/CD pipeline design for the OpenIMSDK Helm charts to ensure their reliability and stability. The aim is to automate testing and deployment processes, reducing manual intervention and increasing efficiency.

## Definitions
[definitions]: #definitions

- CI/CD: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment
- Helm Chart: A package containing pre-configured Kubernetes resources
- Kubernetes: An open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications

## Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

- To automate the testing and deployment of OpenIMSDK Helm charts.
- To detect issues early in the development cycle.
- To provide a stable and reliable deployment process for users.

## What it is
[what-it-is]: #what-it-is

A CI/CD pipeline for automating the testing, validation, and deployment of OpenIMSDK Helm charts. This will include linting, unit testing, integration testing, and automated release processes.

## How it Works
[how-it-works]: #how-it-works

- **Linting**: Helm charts will be validated using `helm lint`, ensuring that they follow best practices and are free of syntax errors. This includes checking for any deprecated API usage.
  
- **Unit Testing**: Utilize tools like `helm unittest` to test individual templates within the Helm charts. This will help in verifying the logic of templates and their outputs for different input values.

- **Integration Testing**: Implement automated end-to-end tests that deploy the Helm charts in a Kubernetes cluster (can be a minikube or a kind cluster). This step will validate that all components of the Helm charts work together as expected. It will include testing of deployment, services, ingress, and any other Kubernetes resources defined by the Helm chart.

- **Security Scanning**: Integrate a security scanning tool (like Trivy or Clair) to scan for vulnerabilities in the container images specified in the Helm charts. This step ensures that the images used are secure and up to date.

- **Dependency Update Checks**: Regularly check for updates in Helm chart dependencies. Automate the process of updating these dependencies and triggering subsequent tests to ensure compatibility.

- **Automated Versioning and Chart Packaging**: Implement a versioning strategy for the Helm charts. Use semantic versioning and automatically bump chart versions based on the type of changes (major, minor, or patch). Package the charts using `helm package`.

- **Publishing**: On successful completion of all tests, automatically publish the Helm charts to a Helm repository. This could be a public repository like Helm Hub or a private one within the organization.

- **Notification and Reporting**: Integrate notifications to alert the team in case of failed builds or tests. Also, generate reports of test results for review and audit purposes.

- **Documentation Update**: Ensure that any changes in the Helm charts are automatically reflected in the documentation. This could be achieved by scripting documentation generation as part of the CI/CD process.

## Migration
[migration]: #migration

N/A – This RFC does not involve changes that require migration.

## Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

- Initial setup requires time and resources.
- Complexity in maintaining the pipeline.

## Alternatives
[alternatives]: #alternatives

- Continue manual testing and deployment: This is less efficient and more prone to errors.
- Use third-party CI/CD tools: This could introduce dependencies and potential security issues.

## Prior Art
[prior-art]: #prior-art

Similar CI/CD processes are used in various open-source projects to ensure the quality and reliability of software releases.

## Unresolved Questions
[unresolved-questions]: #unresolved-questions

- What specific tools and services will be used in the pipeline?
- How will versioning be handled in the automated release process?
